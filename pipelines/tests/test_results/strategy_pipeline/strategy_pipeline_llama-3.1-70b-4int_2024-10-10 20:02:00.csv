What is the size of the city's resident population?,Санкт-Петербург,The population of the city is 7825.4 thousand people.,"Chunk 0: Measures implemented within the framework of the strategic direction for human capital development affect the health care, education and science, culture, physical culture and sports, social support and public services. There is a close relationship between these systems, which ensures a high quality of human capital and is the basis for the growth of the St. Petersburg economy. The implementation of measures in these areas made it possible to achieve certain results of St. Petersburg's socio-economic development in these areas in 2014-2017. In terms of permanent population, St. Petersburg ranks 4th among the constituent entities of the Russian Federation after Moscow, the Moscow Region, and the Krasnodar Territory. At the end of 2017, the permanent population of St. Petersburg was 5351.9 thousand people (3.6% of the total population in the Russian Federation and 38.4% of the total population in the Northwestern Federal District). The average annual population growth compared to 2012 was 1.07 times in 2017, which was 89% of the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, established by the 2030 Strategy (1.2 times). Chunk 1: a city open to people and positive changes, proclaiming generally recognized social values and actively participating in public events, integrated into international processes. St. Petersburg strives to be open to its residents and guests, people who want to come here to study or work. Every resident strives to be part of what St. Petersburg lives by, and to be an integral part of its life. Residents of St. Petersburg are open and friendly, love their city, are proud of its culture and history, and actively participate in public events in St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg creates conditions for socialization, socio-cultural adaptation, and active inclusion of foreign citizens in its life. Cultural heritage is a basic element of citywide identity, the most important factor shaping the attitude of citizens and visitors to St. Petersburg. Saint Petersburg is a city with developed trade, economic, scientific, educational, cultural and humanitarian ties with the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, as well as with foreign countries. The implementation of the ""Open City"" priority will allow St. Petersburg to become a place of attraction, a world-class social, business and cultural center. Chunk 2: The degree of satisfaction of the population of St. Petersburg with the level of their personal security is also growing and amounted to 70.8% in 2014, 73.0% in 2015, 73.2% in 2016, and 88.2% in 2017, which is 1.6 times higher than the planned value of this target indicator for 2030 set by the 2030 Strategy (55%). The population of St. Petersburg is multiethnic and multi-religious. St. Petersburg has always been and remains a city that combines the culture, art and traditions of people belonging to different nationalities, religious and ethnic groups, who differ from each other in their temperament, customs and customs. The migration attractiveness of St. Petersburg in comparison with other regions of the Russian Federation that receive migrants is traditionally one of the highest in Russia. Every year more and more residents from other regions of the Russian Federation and from abroad come to St. Petersburg. In 2015, 64.6% of St. Petersburg residents positively assessed the state of interethnic relations, which is 1.5 times higher than in 2014 (44.2%). In 2016, this share decreased by 5.7 percentage points and amounted to 58.9%. Chunk 3: the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, established in the Strategy 2030 (78 years), was 96.7%. Serious problems remain the persistence of disproportions in the ratio of the male and female population of St. Petersburg and a significant gap in their life expectancy, which is caused by the high mortality rate of men of working age. The population growth in St. Petersburg in 2017 by more than 91% was due to migration growth. For foreign citizens, St. Petersburg is attractive due to its large-scale labor market, higher wages than the average in the Russian Federation, and the presence of a large demand for labor. After reducing the migration growth in 2015 by more than two times (from 52.8 thousand people in 2014 to 25.3 thousand people in 2015), in 2016 the migration growth increased 1.8 times and amounted to 44.7 thousand people. The positive dynamics continued in 2017 - migration growth increased by 1.4 ",The permanent population of St. Petersburg at the end of 2017 was 5351.9 thousand people.,2.091874,0.0,"The actual output states a population of 5351.9 thousand, which is significantly lower than the expected output of 7825.4 thousand, indicating a major inaccuracy.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question about the city's resident population without any irrelevant statements.,2.091874
What is the average total area of residential premises per inhabitant in the city?,Санкт-Петербург,The total area of residential premises per average resident in Saint Petersburg is 31.49 sq. m.,"Chunk 0: 831 individual housing buildings was completed). The volume of St. Petersburg's housing stock at the end of 2017 was 133.1 million square meters. m. The total housing area was 24.9 square meters per person, which corresponds to 71% of the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, set by the 2030 Strategy (35 square meters). In 2014-2017, 12 general education organizations for 10.5 thousand places, 55 preschool educational organizations for 9.8 thousand places, 7 outpatient and polyclinic organizations for 2.4 thousand visits per shift, hospital organizations for 1174 beds, 505.2 thousand square meters of retail space were put into operation. Trade is an important part of St. Petersburg's economy, accounting for more than 20% of GRP in 2016. The consumer market infrastructure in St. Petersburg is one of the largest in the Russian Federation.It is represented by organizations of various types, types, forms and formats. Saint Petersburg occupies one of the leading positions in the Russian Federation in terms of providing the population with retail facilities: Chunk 1: Main settlement zone (""sleeping areas"" or ""peripheral areas"") - territories of microdistrict development of Leningrad - Saint Petersburg in the 1960s and 2010s with the dominance of multi-family residential buildings. Its area is about 23.9 thousand hectares. The main settlement belt includes Krasnoselsky, Kirovsky, Moskovsky, Frunzensky, Nevsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Kalininsky, Vyborgsky and Primorsky districts of St. Petersburg. Approximately two-thirds of the population of St. Petersburg (about 3,460,000 people) lives within the main settlement zone, and less than one-third of the places of employment are located, which are mainly represented by objects of education, healthcare, social services, trade and services. ""Sleeping areas"" are characterized by unbalanced use of the territory, monotony of development, increased population density and gradual large-scale dilapidation of the housing stock. Chunk 2: of Solnechnoye, Repino, Komarovo, Ushkovo, Serovo, Molodezhnoye and Smolyachkovo). The coastal strip with a length of more than 45 km, unique natural landscapes with sandy beaches, and an authentic planning structure make this territory a favorite holiday destination for residents of St. Petersburg and determine its specialization in recreational and health-improving functions. Since the 1990s, local projects for the construction of low-rise and individual housing of a high price level have also been implemented in this territory, mainly on the basis of redevelopment of recreation and tourism facilities and sanatorium-resort facilities, as well as reconstruction of the existing housing and dacha stock. (Paragraph as amended by - See ) Saint Petersburg and the adjacent territories of the Leningrad Region actually form a single territorial space with a total population exceeding 6 million people, characterized by intensive economic, labor, transport, educational, household, cultural, recreational and other connections (hereinafter referred to as the agglomeration of Saint Petersburg and Chunk 3: low level of efficiency in the use of natural resources; high degree of depreciation of fixed assets of hazardous production facilities; an increase in the volume of production and consumption waste generated at a low level of their utilization, including due to a shortage of facilities for processing, recycling and neutralization of municipal and industrial solid waste, as well as the lack of free territories for waste disposal; high level of air and water pollution, as well as the level of motor vehicle noise in residential and public areas; negative impact of geological processes (coastal destruction and flooding, formation of biogas, karst development, surface erosion) caused by climate changes and increased anthropogenic load; low level of wastewater treatment at facilities located in the Leningrad region, near the borders of St. Petersburg. Positive trends in the development of the demographic situation in St. Petersburg are one of the main components that ensure the realization of the potential for further economic growth in St. Petersburg. The population growth rate of St. Petersburg exceeds the corresponding indicators of Moscow and a number of European cities. ",The total housing area was 24.9 square meters per person.,2.076338,0.3,"The actual output provides a numerical value for housing area per person, but it is significantly lower than the expected value of 31.49 sq. m., indicating a lack of accuracy in reflecting the core information.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question about the average total area of residential premises per inhabitant in the city without any irrelevant statements.,2.076338
What is the share of dilapidated housing in the city?,Санкт-Петербург,The share of dilapidated and dilapidated housing stock in the total volume of housing stock is 0%.,"Chunk 0: Main settlement zone (""sleeping areas"" or ""peripheral areas"") - territories of microdistrict development of Leningrad - Saint Petersburg in the 1960s and 2010s with the dominance of multi-family residential buildings. Its area is about 23.9 thousand hectares. The main settlement belt includes Krasnoselsky, Kirovsky, Moskovsky, Frunzensky, Nevsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Kalininsky, Vyborgsky and Primorsky districts of St. Petersburg. Approximately two-thirds of the population of St. Petersburg (about 3,460,000 people) lives within the main settlement zone, and less than one-third of the places of employment are located, which are mainly represented by objects of education, healthcare, social services, trade and services. ""Sleeping areas"" are characterized by unbalanced use of the territory, monotony of development, increased population density and gradual large-scale dilapidation of the housing stock. Chunk 1: non-compliance of the legal regulation of urban development activities with long-term trends in the economy and social sphere, which causes disproportions in the spatial development of St. Petersburg; lack of legal regulation of the status of agglomerations in the Russian Federation, as well as their development processes. A favorable environment is largely provided by the green fund of St. Petersburg. The area of green spaces in St. Petersburg per 1 sq. m is higher than in Amsterdam and Hamburg (0.14 sq. m), but 2 times lower than in Vienna (0.51 sq. m). Despite the relatively high specific rates of landscaping in St. Petersburg, there is a lack of well-maintained green areas in comparison with other Russian and European cities. At the same time, St. Petersburg has sufficient potential to expand the total area of landscaped green areas. A high level of wastewater treatment (98.5%) and the level of radiation background within the long-term average annual values in the territory of St. Petersburg are significant components of a high level of quality of life in St. Petersburg. Chunk 2: The system of outdoor (street) lighting in St. Petersburg is represented by 324.7 thousand lamps, 243 objects of artistic and decorative lighting, as well as 6.9 thousand km of air and cable networks.

The degree of deterioration of infrastructure increased from 41.5% in 2014 to 43.8% in 2015 and 46.3% in 2016, while in 2017 it decreased to 46.0%. The level of achievement of the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, established by the 2030 Strategy (no more than 20%), was 43%. The degree of satisfaction of the population of St. Petersburg with the level of housing and communal services remained low and amounted to 41.9% in 2017, which corresponds to 46.6% of the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, established by the 2030 Strategy (90%). Chunk 3: in the distribution network-96.5%. According to the results of 2017, 79.4% of St. Petersburg residents positively assessed the level of improvement of the living environment, which allowed 88% to reach the planned value of this target indicator for 2030, established by the 2030 Strategy (90%). The state of ecology in St. Petersburg is determined by a relatively high rate of municipal solid waste generation (hereinafter referred to as MSW) and a relatively low amount of MSW sent for processing, disposal, and neutralization. In St. Petersburg, in 2017, about 15.1% of the total MSW generated was sent for processing and neutralization. The presence of a large number of industrial enterprises leads to soil contamination in industrial areas, and large-scale housing construction leads to the emergence of unauthorized landfills and the need for processing, recycling and neutralization of industrial waste, including the highest hazard class.

In 2017, 67 stations operated on the metro lines, 15 of which form 7 major transport and interchange hubs connected to railway stations and stations of external and suburban passenger transport. Currently, the metro is the most popular form of public passenger transport in St. Petersburg, accounting for more than 50% of passenger traffic, and provides the highest average speed of movement-32-40 km / h (the average speed of movement by bus, tram and trolleybus is no more than 15-18 km / h). Chunk 1: Urban passenger transport is represented by metro and ground passenger transport (buses, trams, trolleybuses). The total volume of passenger traffic by urban passenger transport in 2017 amounted to 1,582 million passengers (in 2014-1,560 million passengers, in 2015-1,581 million passengers, in 2016-1,589 million passengers). Currently, there is a three-level structure of the passenger transport system in accordance with the nature, length and duration of the main transport attractions of the population: agglomeration connections (city - suburb), main intra - city connections (peripheral district - city center, peripheral district-peripheral district) and local intra-city connections (intra-district or between adjacent districts). The basis of the St. Petersburg urban passenger transport system is the metro, whose main task is to provide long-distance intra-city transportation of the population in the directions characterized by the most powerful passenger flows between the Chunk 2: commuter rail transport is not integrated into the urban passenger transport system, and there are not enough multi-level intersections with railway tracks. The system of municipal infrastructure and energy is the most important element of life support for the urban economy of St. Petersburg. The system of municipal infrastructure and energy of Saint Petersburg is understood as a complex of technologically interconnected objects and engineering structures intended for the production and transfer of municipal resources in the areas of heat, electricity, gas, water supply, sanitation, as well as outdoor lighting and artistic lighting. As of the end of 2017, the municipal infrastructure and energy system of Saint Petersburg has the following characteristics: Thermal energy production is carried out at 14 combined heat and power plants (hereinafter referred to as CHPPs) and 1,183 boiler houses. The volume of useful heat supply to consumers is 42.6 million tons.Gcal per year, while about 50% of thermal energy is produced in the Chunk 3: of the Kronshtadtsky district of St. Petersburg, it is also necessary to ensure the implementation of investment projects in the field of transport (logistics infrastructure, sea terminal, yacht tourism center, regional airport). For the development of industrial zones, it is necessary to ensure the application of an integrated approach to the development of territories, within the framework of which work is being carried out on integrated urban planning, engineering and transport preparation of sites. 5.2.

Currently, the metro is the most popular form of public passenger transport in St. Petersburg, accounting for more than 50% of passenger traffic, and provides the highest average speed of movement-32-40 km / h (the average speed of movement by bus, tram and trolleybus is no more than 15-18 km / h). Chunk 1: lack of direct transport links between Pulkovo Airport and Saint Petersburg railway stations; growth of transit cargo traffic through St. Petersburg. The internal transport system, while maintaining its multimodality, generally does not meet the growing needs of St. Petersburg. In terms of motorization, St. Petersburg is comparable to Moscow (322 cars per 1000 people) and Amsterdam (329 cars per 1000 people). Given the limited opportunities for expanding the street and road network, especially in the central part of St. Petersburg, the realization of the development potential of the internal transport system of St. Petersburg is possible due to curbing the growth in the use of personal vehicles and the development of a public transport network, organizing parking space, developing a system of bicycle routes and rental, which is a global trend in the management of transport complexes. The main favorable factors contributing to the development of the internal transport system in St. Petersburg can be: introduction of ""smart technologies"" and effective design solutions in the development of the street and road network, including those providing for the formation of highways that ensure the diversion of transit traffic from the center of St. Petersburg and the redistribution of traffic flows; Chunk 2: territory of the ""Gray Belt"" includes the territories of all districts of St. Petersburg, with the exception of Petrodvorets, Krasnoselsky, Pushkinsky, Kolpinsky, Kurortny and Kronshtadtsky districts of St. Petersburg. Currently, the territories of the"" Gray Belt "" are dominated by industrial and communal buildings, including areas where transport infrastructure facilities are located. Residential development is fragmented (the total population does not exceed 350 thousand people). Since 2005, investment activity has significantly increased in the implementation of projects for the construction and reconstruction of public-business and residential facilities on the territory of the ""Gray Belt"", including as part of a comprehensive transformation of the territory. The ""Gray Belt"" is characterized by low transport connectivity of territories due to the low development of the road network and the presence of railway transport territories. Chunk 3: Against the background of rapid growth in the level of motorization, the average speed of traffic during peak hours by bus, tram and trolleybus is 5-10 km / h, and by private vehicles-an average of 8-12 km/h. Most of the bus routes in St. Petersburg run more than 15 minutes apart during peak hours. The average travel time for work purposes is 28% longer than the maximum comfortable travel time to work for an 8-hour working day (50 minutes) and is 64 minutes (including 67 minutes by public transport and 59 minutes by private transport). 81.9% of St. Petersburg residents were satisfied with the quality of public transport services in 2017, which was 91% of the target value of this target indicator for 2030 set by the 2030 Strategy (90%). Cycling infrastructure is actively developing in St. Petersburg: at the end of 2017, the length of bike paths in St. Petersburg was 79.4 km.

What is holding back the spatial development of St. Petersburg?,Санкт-Петербург,"The main weaknesses and constraints to effective and rational spatial development of St. Petersburg are::

- an imbalance in the provision of the population of St. Petersburg with housing, places of employment, social, transport, municipal infrastructure, landscaping facilities and public spaces;
- the discrepancy between the legal regulation of urban development activities and long-term trends in the economy and social sphere, which causes disproportions in the spatial development of St. Petersburg;
- lack of legal regulation of the status of agglomerations in the Russian Federation, as well as their development processes.
","Chunk 0: At the same time, the current monocentric model of spatial development of St. Petersburg has led to a number of serious imbalances in the development of the territory of St. Petersburg. The main problems of the development of the historical center of St. Petersburg are the deterioration of engineering networks and housing stock, the increasing dilapidation of buildings and structures of historical value, the overload of transport infrastructure due to the concentration of pendulum migrations of the population, the insufficient level of comfort and safety of the urban environment, including on the main tourist routes. Serious obstacles to the development of the ""Gray Belt"" territories are the low transport connectivity of the territories due to the low development of the street and road network and the presence of barriers in the form of railway transport territories, as well as the need for land reclamation and changes in sanitary protection zones. The main problems of socio-economic development of ""sleeping areas"" are the monotony of development, increased population density with a lack of places of employment and the gradual large-scale dilapidation of the housing stock. Chunk 1: The development of the outer belt of active urban development of St. Petersburg and the belt of suburban settlement is determined by difficult transport accessibility, lack of social infrastructure facilities, extremely high population density and lack of places for employment. The main favorable factors contributing to the efficient and rational spatial development of St. Petersburg can be: the active position of the state authorities of St. Petersburg in taking into account the interests of developers in relation to the implementation of investment projects that affect the spatial aspects of St. Petersburg's development, the formation of new zones of industrial, public-business and housing development, redevelopment of territories; the growing need of the population of St. Petersburg to ensure compactness and connectivity of the territories of St. Petersburg. The main weaknesses and constraints to effective and rational spatial development of St. Petersburg are: an imbalance in the provision of housing, places of employment, social, transport, and municipal infrastructure facilities, landscaping facilities, and public spaces for the population of St. Petersburg; Chunk 2: Under these external conditions, the socio-economic development of St. Petersburg will be of an inertial nature with the predominance of conservative approaches to managing the development of the economy of St. Petersburg and a slow improvement in macroeconomic indicators. St. Petersburg will develop primarily through extensive economic development by increasing the use of resources, taking advantage of competitive advantages in traditional sectors of the economy and the existing system of territorial structure. Low growth rates will lead to a decrease in the rate of modernization of production and labor productivity growth. St. Petersburg will retain its position as one of the leaders in the scientific and technological sphere due to the high concentration of scientific organizations, but insufficient financial expenditures on research and development will not allow St. Petersburg enterprises to create competitive innovative products. If the St. Petersburg industry remains dominated by industries with high specific consumption of energy and water resources, as well as the level of emissions and waste, a significant deterioration of the environment in St. Petersburg is not expected. Chunk 3: The territory of St. Petersburg has an area of 144.6 thousand square meters.ha and is characterized by significant heterogeneity in the prevailing types of use, development parameters and infrastructure availability. An important factor in the spatial development of St. Petersburg is its location in the Neva River Delta with a low-lying, mostly flat terrain and direct access to the coast of the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea. The favorable geographical location and historical heritage of St. Petersburg determine its important role in the system of international economic relations as a Russian ""window"" to Europe, an important transport, logistics and tourist center of world significance. A unique feature of the spatial development of St. Petersburg is that the structure of its territory was formed in three stages under the influence of three different models of socio-economic and political development: 1. Systematic formation of the territory of the capital of the Russian Empire according to the best European models of architecture and urban planning (from the moment of its foundation until 1917). ","The main weaknesses and constraints to effective and rational spatial development of St. Petersburg are an imbalance in the provision of housing, places of employment, social, transport, and municipal infrastructure facilities, landscaping facilities, and public spaces for the population of St. Petersburg.

The development of public spaces is not only a guarantee of balanced development of territories, but also contributes to economic growth and attracting investment in the economy of St. Petersburg. Investments in public spaces lead to an increase in business activity and tourist attractiveness of the territories. Improving the efficiency of public space use is possible by developing the potential of St. Petersburg's coastal areas and increasing the area of artificial land plots (alluvial areas). A significant surplus of capacities of the Big Port of Saint Petersburg creates objective prerequisites for optimizing existing capacities and, thus, additional development of the released coastal territories, as well as reallocation of cargo flows. An important distinguishing feature of St. Petersburg, which influences its socio-economic and spatial development, is the presence of a rapidly developing agglomeration of St. Petersburg and part of the territories of the Leningrad Region, which provide the opportunity to form coordinated decisions on the development of the transport system, the location of industrial sites, the construction of housing and engineering and social infrastructure facilities. Chunk 3: The main favorable factors contributing to the increase of scientific and innovative activity in St. Petersburg can be: increased competition in the field of research activities; increased efficiency of interaction (cooperation) of industrial, educational and research organizations in order to develop, transfer and commercialize innovations; active participation of research and production organizations in St. Petersburg.Participation of St. Petersburg in the processes of international scientific and technical cooperation that provide access to advanced technologies, competencies and resources; expansion of St. Petersburg's participation in the implementation of the National Technology Initiative; inflow of venture capital; placement of research and development centers and leading Russian and international companies in St. Petersburg; creation of a favorable innovation ecosystem, including the development of innovative infrastructure, availability of business services.
